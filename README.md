Unemployment Analysis with Python

This repository contains Python code and data files for analyzing unemployment rates using various techniques in Python.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize unemployment data to gain insights into the trends and patterns of unemployment rates. The project focuses on using Python programming language and popular libraries for data analysis and visualization.

Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing: The project includes code for cleaning and preprocessing the raw unemployment data to make it suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various EDA techniques are applied to understand the characteristics of the unemployment data and identify any notable trends or patterns.
Data visualization: The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and choropleth maps.
Statistical analysis: Statistical techniques are employed to analyze the relationships between unemployment rates and other factors, such as region, time, or demographic variables.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms.
Geopandas: Geospatial data analysis and visualization.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Python scripts to perform different analysis tasks or visualize the data.
Refer to the Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step demonstrations and examples.
